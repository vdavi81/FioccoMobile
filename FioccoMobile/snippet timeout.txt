About the timeout, its simple to solve.

Go to:
\platforms\android\cordova\node_modules\q

Locate:
var timeoutId = setTimeout(function () {
deferred.reject(new Error(message || “Timed out after " + ms + " ms”));
}, ms);

Change to:
var timeoutId = setTimeout(function () {
deferred.reject(new Error(message || “Timed out after " + ms + " ms”));
}, 10000000);

Run! You’ll see dependencies being installed. Thats why time was running out! #bug

After all, you can undo the changes.
